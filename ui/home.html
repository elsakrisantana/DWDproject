        <h2>What is <label class="pink-text">Art Therapy?</label></h2>
        <p>
            Art Therapy is a form of expressive therapy that uses the creative process of making art to improve a
            person’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The creative process involved in expressing one’s
            self artistically can help people to resolve issues as well as develop and manage their behaviors and
            feelings, reduce stress, and improve self-esteem and awareness. Art therapy can achieve different things
            for different people. It can be used for counseling by therapists, healing, treatment, rehabilitation,
            psychotherapy, and in the broad sense of the term, it can be used to massage one’s inner-self in a way
            that may provide the individual with a deeper understanding of him or herself.

        <p>
            For the most part, anyone can use art therapy. In a world where there is a multitude of ways to
            communicate and express one’s self, expressive arts therapy is yet another. One of the major differences
            between art therapy and other forms of communication is that most other forms of communication elicit
            the use of words or language as a means of communication. Often times, humans are incapable of
            expressing themselves within this limited range.

        <p>
            Art as therapy is generally used as a treatment for something – usually as a way to improve one’s
            emotional state or mental well-being. Expressive arts therapy doesn’t have to be used only as a
            treatment though. It can be used to relieve stress or tension, or it can be used as a mode of
            self-discovery. Many people can stand to use some sort of creative outlet.
